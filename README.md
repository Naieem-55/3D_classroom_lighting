# 3D Classroom Lighting

This project simulates a 3D classroom environment with dynamic lighting and camera controls. It allows users to explore the scene interactively, adjust camera views, and toggle various lighting effects.

## Features
- **Interactive Camera Movement**: Move the camera around the classroom with customizable controls.
- **Lighting Effects**: Toggle different light types (directional, point, ambient, and spot lights).
- **Realistic Shading**: Enable or disable diffuse and specular lighting.
